Some fans like to read spoilers to get a glimpse of what will happen next, while others prefer to avoid them to enjoy the chapter without any prior knowledge. If you belong to the latter group, we advise you to skip this section and proceed to the next one.</p><p>The spoiler for Record of Ragnarok Chapter 89 is based on the raw scans that are leaked online by some sources. The raw scans are the original Japanese version of the chapter that are scanned and uploaded by some fans before the official release. The raw scans are usually low-quality and may contain errors or inaccuracies. Therefore, they are not a reliable source of information and should be taken with a grain of salt.</p><p>According to the spoiler posted on Reddit by u/Chaos_Theory_123, the chapter will focus on the backstory of Ares and his relationship with his father Zeus. The spoiler reveals that Ares was born as a weak and timid child, who was constantly bullied and mocked by his siblings and other gods. He was also neglected and abused by Zeus, who considered him a disgrace and a failure. Ares grew up with a deep inferiority complex and a desire to prove himself to his father.</p><p>The spoiler also reveals that Ares was the one who killed the Titan Cronus, the father of Zeus, during the Titanomachy, the war between the gods and the titans. Ares did this to impress Zeus and earn his respect, but Zeus was not pleased and instead accused Ares of stealing his glory and being a coward. Ares was devastated and felt betrayed by his father, who never acknowledged his achievements or his love.</p><p>The spoiler ends with a cliffhanger, as Ares prepares to unleash his ultimate attack on Qin Shi Huang, who is also ready to counter with his own secret weapon. The chapter will end with a huge explosion that will shake the arena and leave the outcome of the fight uncertain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Record-Of-Ragnarok-Chapter-89-release-date.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=English_Spoiler_Release_Date></span><strong>English Spoiler Release Date </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>An English spoiler is a translated version of the spoiler that is based on the raw scans.

The chapter continued the ninth round of the tournament between Ares and Qin Shi Huang, and showed the climax of their fight. The chapter began with Ares launching a powerful attack on Qin, who barely dodged it. Qin then activated his Volund’s stealth mode, and tried to sneak up on Ares.</p><p>However, Ares sensed his presence, and stabbed him in the chest with his spear. Qin survived the attack, and revealed that he had implanted a fake heart in his chest, which he used to fool Ares. Qin then used his Volund’s flamethrower to burn Ares, who was caught off guard. Ares managed to escape the flames, and retaliated with his spear.</p><p>Qin blocked the spear with his Volund’s shield, and used his Volund’s drill to pierce Ares’ arm. Ares screamed in pain, and pulled out the drill from his arm. He then threw his spear at Qin, who dodged it. The spear hit the wall behind Qin, and caused a huge explosion. Qin was shocked by the explosion, and realized that Ares’ spear was filled with gunpowder.</p><p>Ares then revealed that he had learned the art of war from humans, and that he had modified his spear to make it more deadly. He then declared that he would show Qin the true meaning of war, and that he would not let him win. The chapter ended with Ares and Qin facing each other, ready for the final clash.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_To_Read_Record_of_Ragnarok_Chapter_89></span><strong>Where To Read Record of Ragnarok Chapter 89?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Record of Ragnarok is a licensed manga series, and the official English translation of the chapters is available on the MangaONE app, which is a digital manga platform operated by Ushio Shuppan.

Their two rap performances, "Parents Just Don't Understand", and "Summertime" won the prestigious Grammy awards, among a lot of other acknowledgement and recognition. The most identifiable thing about Will's rapping style is its way of storytelling about teenage issues in an entertaining and safe manner.</p><p class=align-left>The rapper went on to pursue his solo career, and around that time, he decided to take on a new challenge — acting. As a solo performer, he also reached tremendous successes, releasing four albums and winning two more Grammy awards for "Men in Black" and "Gettin' Jiggy Wit It" performances. The TV show "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air", where he starred in the leading role from 1990 to 1996, boosted his popularity even more and made him an unforgettable actor who could easily land any significant role in Hollywood.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4880a3778b657987.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The fascinating story of John Krasinski: what is "The Office" star up to?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With time, the actor decided to move on and try to win over major Hollywood producers.

The actor decided to bow out of the drama after eight years, with his character Matthew Casey bidding farewell to the Windy City and attempting a long-distance relationship with girlfriend Sylvie Brett.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePIOKg_YMaxo data-wc=47>On leaving the show, he said: "I realized I'd been doing TV for a long time, so I added it up… We were coming up on the 200th episode and I called Derek to break the news that it was time for me to leave the show.</p><p id=e25X9sDuOdxy data-wc=52>"He agreed we should at least get Casey to the 200th episode.<strong> It was a difficult decision because I've loved the show from the start</strong> but there are other things I'd like to do in the future.

The actress couldn't stay away for long, however, as she briefly returned for the season seven premiere as well as for one episode in series eight.&nbsp;</p><p id=eBl3O4-gJvKi data-wc=58>On making the decision to walk away from the show, the actress told the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Chicago Tribune</a> that she felt "<strong>hungry to explore a different role</strong>". "I had been in Chicago for five years and just personally where I was in my life, I was ready to create my home and kind of plant some roots in Los Angeles," she added.&nbsp;</p><p id=e61X1f9x3VTG data-wc=13>The actress is currently starring in Starz crime drama Hightown as Jackie Quiñones.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e6b8652fa5c-monica-raymund-z.jpg><p id=emVyzqNvhJWI data-wc=6><strong>Monica Raymund as paramedic Gabriela Dawson</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Lauren German as Paramedic Leslie Shay</h2><p id=eVlm7HSIxxa2 data-wc=57>Lauren German played Leslie Shay in the NBC drama for the first two seasons until her character was killed off in the dramatic series finale. Leslie was out on a call when she was fatally struck by a collapsing pipe. It was later revealed that the fire was caused by a serial arsonist who was stalking her.&nbsp;</p><p id=eoBwi-EnNicq data-wc=49>Executive producer Matt Olmstead spoke about the reason behind her exit to TV Line, saying: "Going into it, we knew if we were going to do it,<strong> it had to be someone who was going to give us a big impact</strong>, as opposed to going for a lesser-known character."</p><p id=e2UJvieIrt0j data-wc=21>He added that Lauren was "very professional" about leaving the show and even confessed that she wouldn't "miss the Chicago winters".</p><p id=eRFNQhp91HUZ data-wc=27>Not long after her departure from the show, Lauren landed a role in fantasy crime drama Lucifer opposite Tom Ellis, which ran from 2016 until late 2021.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/934b23d108c8-lauren-german-z.jpg><p id=ebDP2u0p7kHy data-wc=8><strong>Lauren German played Leslie Shay for two seasons</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Charlie Barnett as Firefighter Candidate Peter Mills</h2><p id=evcvxeNDszhV data-wc=44><a class=hm-link href=#>Charlie Barnett's exit</a> from the show came not only as a surprise to fans but to the actor too! Charlie, who left the drama in 2015, told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune that he was told about his departure on what he thought was "a normal day of filming".</p><p id=ems0bThdPlDl data-wc=41>"They expressed that it wasn’t about me or myself as an actor or my personality," he said. "But they felt that <strong>Peter had reached a plateau</strong> and the writers didn’t know where to take him because he’s done so much already."</p><p id=exZ7cDVF3f-x data-wc=66>Being let go from the show may have been a blessing in disguise for Charlie, however, as he went on to land several major TV roles in the subsequent years. After appearing as a minor role in Netflix's Orange Is the New Black, he went on to star in two of the streaming site's most popular shows, including comedy-drama, Russian Doll, and season two of You.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9147979b3f8e-charlie-barnett-z.jpg><p id=exXXmVBoZaV6 data-wc=10><strong>Charlie Barnett left his role playing Peter Mills in 2015</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Teri Reeves as Doctor&nbsp;Hallie Thomas</h2><p id=eVx_zGpFo-OR data-wc=36>Teri Reeves played physician Hallie Thomas for 11 episodes in the first series before she was tragically killed off. It was revealed that Halli had been murdered by convicted arsonist Tim Campbell, who was eventually shot.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCc2Bm3lcVyD data-wc=33>While the exact reason why Teri left the programme is unknown, it has been reported that the producers chose to kill her off in order to build the dramatic stakes in season one.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewgoP1Aouc5B data-wc=32>Since starring in the NBC show, the actress has gone on to appear in several major TV series, including Grey's Anatomy and Lucifer, both of which she featured in for one episode.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCcZJiB6QeqI data-wc=23>Viewers may also

trapped in the fire after being hit by an infernal backdraft.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezIoddZCZNP4 data-wc=40>Chatting about the star's exit, creator&nbsp;Derek Haas revealed that instead of placing a major character in danger only to save them, he wanted the audience "to be reminded that these calls are dangerous and sometimes people don’t make it".</p><p id=ebE4mK5l9xTc data-wc=37>"<strong>We thought, what if we killed off Otis and he dies heroically?</strong> We realized there was so much emotional landscape we could cover," he told TV Line, adding that it "needed to be a core cast

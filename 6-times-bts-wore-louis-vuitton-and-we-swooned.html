It's a thrilling partnership, especially with Virgil Abloh at the helm of the brand's menswear category. An American designer's French fashion collections worn by Korean superstars? It's global fusion at its absolute best.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, this won't be the first time BTS has dipped into the luxury fashion house's enviable closets. Louis Vuitton outfits are like stars in the BTS universe, dotting some of the idols' most important moments in the constellation of their recent history.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, let's stargaze a little, shall we?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While this won't be a comprehensive list of every time BTS wore LV, ever, I hope I picked enough of your favorites to overlap with mine. Besides, as always with Bangtan, the best is yet to come.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jimins-airport-drip></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jimin's Airport Drip</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kpop has blessed the world with many things — too many to succinctly name here — but if I were to give you a complete list, one thing on it would be a whole new category of sartorial relevance: Airport style. At airport terminals, where mere mortals wear leggings and sweats, idols drip with unreleased streetwear, luxury labels, and six-figure jewelry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pictures of BTS as they walk from chauffeured car to private airport security are now just as widely circulated as almost any press junket or red carpet event. In these perfectly curated style moments, Bangtan is able to showcase their personal aesthetics without having to coordinate together as an idol group, much like they do for performances and appearances. Freed of those matchy-matchy restrictions, fans are fed with gorgeous individual fits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jimin's sartorial splendor in particular is often punctuated with gems from Louis Vuitton, including a personal favorite: The Wizard of Oz-inspired varsity jacket from Virgil Abloh's Spring/Summer 2019 collection. Whimsical and bright (just like Jimin!), the rare piece is now a Holy Grail for hypebeast collectors, fetching upwards of $8k on resell markets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, speaking of that Wizard of Oz collection. . .</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-saturday-night-live></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Saturday Night LiVe</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Will Heath/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In April of 2019, BTS made their SNL debut as musical guests, performing mega-hits <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>'Boy With Luv'</a> and '<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Mic Drop</a>,' the latter of which might just be my all-time favorite BTS song. It's an anthem to swagger, a glorious stadium-shaking declaration to their awe-inspiring success as global artists. It simultaneously gives a middle finger to the haters ("You thought I was gonna fail but I'm fine, sorry; Sorry Billboard; Sorry worldwide" SUGA boasts), and reminds everyone of their humble underdog roots pre-debut ("Yeah, who said my spoon is dirty?" j-hope asks). What better fashion choice for this huge performance than Virgil Abloh's very first line for Louis Vuitton?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The layers of this moment! This was a Chicago designer's first chance at the helm of an esteemed Parisian fashion label (the first Black artistic director at Louis Vuitton, too, by the way) and, as a major collection motif, Abloh chose to screenprint scenes from an American fairytale, The Wizard of Oz. The story is about a group of misfit friends who band together to travel through an epic adventure — just like our OT7 idols did.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another parallel: Both Virgil and BTS are constantly having to live up the hype they've created, and every time, they silence the critics with pure talent. Go ahead, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>watch the full SNL 'Mic Drop</a>' performance and find a flaw. I dare you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, those Louis Vuitton clothes looked good on them. Like, really good. I may be biased (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pun intended</a>), but RM was particularly crush-worthy in the oversized, tie-dyed parka. ARMY had been treated to a sneak peek of this specific look, since he had worn that same jacket for the music video for his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>MOTS:7 solo song "Persona</a>" just two weeks earlier.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-monsieur-j-hopes-double-denim></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Monsieur j-hope's Double Denim</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the world locked down and BTS had to cancel their 2020 global stadium tour, ARMY feared we might never get to see a performance of j-hope's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>MOTS:7 solo song "Outro:Ego."</a> Luckily for us, Bangtan never lets their fans down, and pivoted to produce a virtual Map of the Soul ON:E concert in October.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In total, almost a million viewers from 191 countries logged on to swoon over our Hobitonin. For the super-special "Ego" debut, j-hope blessed us by donning a rhinestone-encrusted double denim ensemble from Louis Vuitton, which sparkled (almost) as brightly as he did.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-breaking-the-internet-in-lv-pastels--lisa-frank-neon></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Breaking the Internet in LV Pastels & Lisa Frank Neon</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Louis Vuitton</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The brilliant creative team at PAPER magazine really outdid themselves in 2019 for their annual <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Break the Internet edition</a>. The issue paired our favorite global phenomena with Louis Vuitton's Spring/Summer 2020 soft pastels and Lisa Frank's neon-cutie-pie, '90s aesthetic visuals. The results: A spread that drove ARMY downright deranged. Myself included — it's been my lockscreen ever since.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, let's be (Lisa) frank: Nothing says "fuck off" louder to toxic masculinity than this shoot. How very sexy of BTS to continue to upend traditional gender stereotypes. They lead by example, giving their fans the permission and confidence to wear, do, and be whatever makes them happiest. RM said it best when he appeared <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>at the United Nations and gave his now iconic "Love Yourself" speech</a>: "Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin color, gender identity: speak yourself."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sugas-sweet-as-honey-monogram></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>SUGA's Sweet as Honey Monogram</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Things were bleak in August 2020. The world was in one of the thickest, hardest stretches of the COVID pandemic. At best, people were scared, sad, and exhausted. It seemed like everything fun in the world had been cancelled. Then, BTS dropped '<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dynamite</a>'. The song was a cultural reset. A bright and catchy dance track meant to be a balm to our weary souls ("Ladies and gentlemen: I got the medicine so you should keep ya eyes on the ball," RM sings, with his dimple-bracketed smile). Of course, the song became a pop culture juggernaut, smashing records and earning critical and commercial accolades for BTS.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Louis Vuitton once again made a cameo for this very important chapter in BTS history.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the 'Dynamite' music video, SUGA dances across a basketball court in head-to-toe Louis Vuitton logos, layered perfectly with a Tune Squad throwback jersey. The outfit's retro '90s aesthetic is pure joy — I'm into that. I'm good to go.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-we-have-to-talk-about-the-grammys></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>We Have to Talk About the Grammys</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Louis Vuitton</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When BTS was nominated for a Grammy, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>I screamed as hard as Jungkook did</a>. The spetent from Seoul had been long and unduly ignored by the Academy's nomination committee, even as they broke cultural barriers on a global scale, out-sold other Grammy winning artists, and dominated both the American and worldwide charts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the night itself ended with disappointment for ARMY as the Grammys used BTS's influence for clout without rightfully awarding them their American award (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>yes, they absolutely did that</a>), this was still a major moment in BTS's story. It was their first-ever Grammys nomination. It was the first time a Korean group would perform solo at the Grammys. And what, we all wondered with bated breath, would Bangtan Sonyeondan wear for the (virtual) red carpet? They had access to every huge designer in the world — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>for past Grammys nights, they'd worn JayBaek Couture, YSL, and Bottega Veneta</a> — and every label must have been begging to dress them for this historic moment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They ended up picking Louis Vuitton.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bangtan arrived on the live stream (in the middle of their Korean night) wearing pieces from Virgil Abloh's Fall/Winter 2021 Louis Vuitton collection. It was a perfect choice: Suiting remixed and sweetened with touches of wholesome beauty — like RM's stuffed animal creature, clinging to his hoodie strings, and j-hope's exuberant flower corsage — just like BTS.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, let us not forget the grace and humility BTS displayed that chilly night. As #BTSOurGreatestPrize trended, the half-asleep Bangtan men took to V-Live under a "Thanks ♥ Army" balloon banner where RM reminded the fans, "You guys are our prize." (That V-Live clocked in 11.1 million views, by the way. Peak Grammys views were 7.8 million.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2Svtb%2BMpaauoaNiw7a1062mp2WjqcatsQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f6-times-bts-wore-louis-vuitton-and-we-swooned.html&text=6%20Times%20BTS%20Wore%20Louis%20Vuitton%20%28and%20We%20Swooned%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f6-times-bts-wore-louis-vuitton-and-we-swooned.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f6-times-bts-wore-louis-vuitton-and-we-swooned.html&title=6%20Times%20BTS%20Wore%20Louis%20Vuitton%20%28and%20We%20Swooned%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f6-times-bts-wore-louis-vuitton-and-we-swooned.html&title=6%20Times%20BTS%20Wore%20Louis%20Vuitton%20%28and%20We%20Swooned%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f6-times-bts-wore-louis-vuitton-and-we-swooned.html&title=6%20Times%20BTS%20Wore%20Louis%20Vuitton%20%28and%20We%20Swooned%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f6-times-bts-wore-louis-vuitton-and-we-swooned.html&description=6%20Times%20BTS%20Wore%20Louis%20Vuitton%20%28and%20We%20Swooned%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./access-bank-gtbank-zenith-bank-generate-n123-94trn-from-ussd-atm-mobile-banking-others.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Access Bank, GTBank, Zenith Bank Generate N123.94trn From USSD, ATM, Mobile Banking, Others">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./plasma-for-empty-shop-lady-with-few-goods-in-her-store-mounts-costly-television-video-trends.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="&amp;quot;Plasma for Empty Shop?&amp;quot; Lady With Few Goods In Her Store Mounts Costly Television, Video Trends">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

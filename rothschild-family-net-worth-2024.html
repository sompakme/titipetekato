Their wealth is not centralized, and much of it is tied up in private family trusts and holdings that are not publicly disclosed.</p><h3 id=privacy-and-discretion-iHzJsmZolB>Privacy and Discretion</h3><p>The Rothschilds are known for their privacy, which makes it difficult to obtain accurate financial information.

Known for his profound teachings and influential philosophies, Confucius left a lasting impact on Chinese culture and society. His teachings revolved around the concept of moral values, emphasizing the importance of respect, filial piety, and harmonious relationships.

The first known effort was by Michele Ruggieri, who returned to Italy in 1588 and carried on his translations while residing in Salerno. Matteo Ricci started to report on the thoughts of <a href=#>Confucius</a>, and a team of Jesuits—Prospero Intorcetta, Philippe Couplet, and two others—published a translation of several Confucian works and an overview of <a href=#>Chinese</a> history in Paris in 1687. François Noël, after failing to persuade Clement<span class=nowrap>&nbsp;</span>XI that <a href=#>Chinese</a> veneration of ancestors and <a href=#>Confucius</a> did not constitute idolatry, completed the Confucian canon at Prague in 1711, with more scholarly treatments of the other works and the first translation of the collected works of <a href=#>Mencius</a>. It is thought that such works had considerable importance on European thinkers of the period, particularly among the Deists and other philosophical groups of the Enlightenment who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of <a href=#>Confucius</a> into Western civilization.</p><span>1940</span><p>Confucius's family, the Kongs, have the longest recorded extant pedigree in the world today. The father-to-son family tree, now in its 83rd generation, has been recorded since the death of <a href=#>Confucius</a>. According to the <a href=#>Confucius</a> Genealogy Compilation Committee, he has 2 million known and registered descendants, and there are an estimated 3 million in all. Of these, several tens of thousands live outside of China. In the 14th century, a Kong descendant went to Korea, where an estimated 34,000 descendants of <a href=#>Confucius</a> live today. One of the main lineages fled from the Kong ancestral home in Qufu during the <a href=#>Chinese</a> Civil War in the 1940s and eventually settled in <a href=#>Taiwan</a>. There are also branches of the Kong family who have converted to Islam after marrying Muslim women, in Dachuan in Gansu province in the 1800s, and in 1715 in Xuanwei city in Yunnan province. Many of the Muslim <a href=#>Confucius</a> descendants are descended from the marriage of Ma Jiaga (马甲尕), a Muslim woman, and Kong Yanrong (孔彦嵘), 59th generation descendant of <a href=#>Confucius</a> in the year 1480 and are found among the Hui and Dongxiang peoples. The new genealogy includes the Muslims. Kong Dejun (孔德軍) is a prominent Islamic scholar and Arabist from Qinghai province and a 77th generation descendant of <a href=#>Confucius</a>.</p><span>1949</span><p>The attackers retreated after realizing that they would have to become rebels against the state and their lord. Through Confucius's actions, the Bi officials had inadvertently revolted against their own lord, thus forcing Viscount Ji Huan's hand in having to dismantle the walls of Bi (as it could have harbored such rebels) or confess to instigating the event by going against proper conduct and righteousness as an official. Dubs (1949) suggests that the incident brought to light Confucius's foresight, practical political ability, and insight into human character.</p><span>2006</span><p>Despite repeated dynastic change in China, the title of Duke Yansheng was bestowed upon successive generations of descendants until it was abolished by the Nationalist Government in 1935. The last holder of the title, Kung Te-cheng of the 77th generation, was appointed Sacrificial Official to <a href=#>Confucius</a>. Kung Te-cheng died in October 2008, and his son, Kung Wei-yi, the 78th lineal descendant, had died in 1989. Kung Te-cheng's grandson, Kung Tsui-chang, the 79th lineal descendant, was born in 1975; his great-grandson, Kung Yu-jen, the 80th lineal descendant, was born in Taipei on January 1, 2006. Te-cheng's sister, Kong Demao, lives in mainland China and has written a book about her experiences growing up at the family estate in Qufu. Another sister, Kong Deqi, died as a young woman. Many descendants of <a href=#>Confucius</a> still live in Qufu today.</p><span>2009</span><p>The fifth and most recent edition of the <a href=#>Confucius</a> genealogy was printed by the <a href=#>Confucius</a> Genealogy Compilation Committee (CGCC). It was unveiled in a ceremony at Qufu on September 24, 2009. Women are now included for the first time.</p><span>2013</span><p>In 2013 a DNA test performed on multiple different families who claimed descent from <a href=#>Confucius</a> found that they shared the same Y chromosome as reported by Fudan University.</p><span>2014</span><p>Under the succeeding Han Dynasty and Tang dynasty, Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence. Under Wudi, the works of <a href=#>Confucius</a> were made the official imperial philosophy and required reading for civil <a href=#>Service</a> examinations in 140 BC which was continued nearly unbroken until the end of the 19th century. As Mohism lost support by the time of the Han, the main philosophical contenders were Legalism, which Confucian thought somewhat absorbed, the teachings of Laozi, whose focus on more spiritual ideas kept it from direct conflict with Confucianism, and the new Buddhist religion, which gained acceptance during the Southern and Northern Dynasties era. Both Confucian ideas and Confucian-trained officials were relied upon in the Ming Dynasty and even the Yuan Dynasty, although <a href=#>Kublai Khan</a> distrusted handing over provincial control to them.</p><span>2016</span><p>The name "Confucius" is a Latinized form of the Mandarin <a href=#>Chinese</a> "Kǒng Fūzǐ" (<span lang=zh title="Chinese language text" xml:lang=zh>孔夫子</span>, meaning "Master Kong"), and was coined in the late 16th century by the early Jesuit missionaries to China. Confucius's clan name was "Kǒng" (<span lang=zh title="Chinese language text" xml:lang=zh>孔</span>; Old Chinese: *<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class=IPA>kʰˤoŋʔ</span>), and his given name was "Qiū" (<span lang=zh title="Chinese language text" xml:lang=zh>丘</span>; OC: *<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class=IPA>kʷʰə</span>). His "capping name", given upon reaching adulthood and by which he would have been known to all but his older family members, was "Zhòngní" (<span lang=zh title="Chinese language text" xml:lang=zh>仲尼</span>; OC: *<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)" class=IPA>N-truŋ-s nrəj</span>), the "Zhòng" indicating that he was the second son in his family.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>551 BC births</a> <a href=#>479 BC deaths</a> <a href=#>6th-century BC Chinese people</a> <a href=#>5th-century BC Chinese people</a> <a href=#>6th-century BC philosophers</a> <a href=#>5th-century BC philosophers</a> <a href=#>5th-century BC historians</a> <a href=#>Philosophers from Lu (state)</a> <a href=#>Confucius</a> <a href=#>Classical humanists</a> <a href=#>Confucianism</a> <a href=#>Education theory</a> <a href=#>Founders of religions</a> <a href=#>Guqin players</a> <a href=#>Moral philosophers</a> <a href=#>People from Qufu</a> <a href=#>Zhou dynasty historians</a> <a href=#>Deified Chinese people</a> <a href=#>Historians from Shandong</a> <a href=#>Gong clan of Qufu</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeTpLunwcKirKxlnprBbsPOq6uhZWVrhHaB</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fconfucius-net-worth.html&text=Confucius%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fconfucius-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fconfucius-net-worth.html&title=Confucius%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fconfucius-net-worth.html&title=Confucius%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fconfucius-net-worth.html&title=Confucius%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fconfucius-net-worth.html&description=Confucius%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./darnell-robinson-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Darnell Robinson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bryan-danielson-really-wants-kazuchika-okada-to-choose-aew-over-wwe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bryan Danielson Really Wants Kazuchika Okada to Choose AEW Over WWE">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

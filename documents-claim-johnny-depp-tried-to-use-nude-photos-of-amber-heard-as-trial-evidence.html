My ex-c—t is goddamn TEXTBOOK!!!" according to the document.</p><p>Then Manson, in an apparent reference to an incident where the police were called to Depp and Heard's shared Los Angeles apartment in 2016, wrote, "I got a serious police amber type scenarios with L's family.

This raises significant concerns of manipulation, alteration, and deletion."</p><p>Documents show Heard's team repeatedly requested the full audio of these conversations, but were denied.</p><p>Julian Ackert, the forensic expert who testified for Heard during the trial and confirmed photos of her bruised face allegedly at the hands of Depp were authentic, found that Depp's submitted photos contained "anomalies that call into question the authenticity of the multimedia documents".</p><p>Ackert, who was only questioned under cross-examination in the trial, said these included "instances where the date metadata, such as creation and date metadata, is either missing or is significantly after the alleged date of the incident. Missing creation dates and/or modification dates that post-date the facts can be a sign of digital evidence manipulation."</p><h2 class=article__heading>Witnesses Depp's team fought to block</h2><p>While Ackert's testimony was blocked, Depp's team unsuccessfully moved for several of Heard's witnesses to be excluded from the trial.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>These included the testimony of actress Ellen Barkin, who'd claimed Depp angrily threw a bottle in her direction while they were dating; Dr David Spiegel, a psychiatrist who testified on behalf of Heard about the alleged trauma inflicted by Depp; texts between Depp and his actor/pal Paul Bettany wherein Bettany suggested they submit Heard to a "drowning test" to determine whether or not she's a "witch," to which Depp replied, "Let's drown her before we burn her!!! I will f*** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead"; and audio of Heard telling Depp, "I had dumped you a f***ing week, week prior, a f***ing week prior after you beat the sh*t out of me."</p><p>However, the testimony of Dr Dawn M. Hughes, a psychologist who met with Heard for 29 hours over four sessions and determined that she suffered from PTSD as a result of "intimate partner violence" by Depp, was removed before the trial went ahead.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Heard's list of 'comparable actors'</h2><p>Meanwhile, the documents outlined a pre-trial claim by Heard's team that the actress suffered economic losses in the range of "$47-50 million" over a "3-5 year period" due to defamatory statements made by Depp and his inner circle.</p><p>The claim featured a list of actors her lawyers felt were "comparable" to Heard in stature, including Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, Zendaya, Ana de Armas, and Chris Pine.</p><h2 class=article__heading>Heard intends to appeal</h2><p>Heard, 36, filed a "notice of intent to appeal" last Thursday in Fairfax County, Virginia, close to Washington DC where the blockbuster trial was heard.</p><p>Heard plans to appeal against the verdict, a decision on post-trial motions and "all additional orders and rulings by the trial court," the filing states, reported The New York Post.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a

County jury sided with the 59-year-old Pirates of the Caribbean actor last month, finding that his ex-wife defamed him in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed piece on being a victim of domestic abuse.</p><p>The Aquaman actor won a US$2 million jury verdict against Depp on one of her claims that he defamed her.</p><p>Heard's appeal comes on the heels of a judge last week denying her bid for a new trial on multiple grounds, including that one juror prejudiced the outcome of the case.</p><p>In a statement on Thursday, Heard's team said it believes "the court made errors that prevented a just and fair verdict consistent with the First Amendment."</p><p>Depp's side, meanwhile, expressed continued confidence in their case.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading

I'm wearing our dress in a special edition that we did in white paired with the matching <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Belo sweate</a>r.</p><h3>Day Three - Paris</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7a098c4573a6-img5416.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/df841a82f497-screenshot-2023-11-13-173131.png><p id=eJs_gN_JHe data-wc=22>This was another day of meetings and walking some considerable distances too. I was wearing our <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Bronze Dress</a> With our <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Belo jacket</a>.</p><h3>Day 4 - Brussels</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/328a78be5d73-img4875.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7281db2c4bfe-img4890.jpg><p id=e89WLDSb-yIK data-wc=41>A day wandering around Brussels, I love visiting museums and vintage markets here - it's one of my favourite European cities. I wore our <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Bruno Pants</a> with a solid Angora knit from Zara, our <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Carmesi coat</a> and purple sneakers from Veja.</p><h3>Day 5 - London</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5b0a554850fe-img5185.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/16aa29fe6b35-screenshot-2023-11-14-144815.png><p id=e4DxcC4npDe data-wc=30>This day I was in London for a very special meeting. I am wearing a matching dress and trench coat featuring beautiful prints by Poppy Birkby, paired with Jacquemus boots.</p><h3>The Fashion Insider low-down:</h3><p id=efAm27d_1_r data-wc=5><strong>What are your go-to brands?</strong></p><p id=eVGwd3eI93t data-wc=56>I always wear my own brand, but if not, I will wear vintage. I'm a huge fan of vintage fashion and I loved Sonia Rykiel when she was alive and the collections that she was doing. I also invest in shoes - I love shoes. I love Marni accessories and JW Anderson as well for bags.</p><p id=eNGeP7GBdXlK data-wc=13><strong>Do you have any fashion icons or inspirations that influence your style choices?</strong></p><p id=ecXG7H7O1oXZ data-wc=41>I have more style eras than style icons, like the seventies for instance. I love watching seventies movies and music videos. I love designers that work with greens like Zandra Rhodes and I get inspired by their work for my work.</p><p id=eb5HZkWk4R data-wc=7><strong>How do you balance comfort with style?</strong></p><p id=eK9thhOCsG data-wc=31>The way I balance comfort is with trainers. These days I think it is super important to keep feet comfortable and there are lots of beautiful pairs out there right now.&nbsp;</p><p id=euIimU2by8Eg data-wc=15><strong>What is your weekday wardrobe like? And how is it different from your weekend wardrobe?</strong></p><p id=ejNjIyrD9Xi_ data-wc=95>Because I work in fashion, my weekday wardrobe is wearing my own clothes. When I go to the studio, there are always people coming in and I like them to see the collections on me. &nbsp;I take care of the accessories I wear and the clothes I wear and it's not an effort for me, because I have a lot of fun doing it. But on weekends, if I go outside for a hike, I might wear something outdoorsy, but still colourful and still from my brand because we have a range of clothing styles.</p><p id=eZEFXr-E8fOJ data-wc=5><strong>What are your must-have accessories?</strong></p><p id=e143RMKhqT3h data-wc=83>I love accessories, in fact, I started out as an accessory designer. I always travel with nice charms and nice statement earrings - I love them. Bags are super important as well as shoes and hats. I sometimes travel with a hat carrier, especially when I used to go to Miami for Art Basel. Accessories are part of the whole styling so I couldn’t choose just one. It depends on the outfit and on the mood but I will for sure wear accessories.</p><p id=e-HpS_zJ0ZMy data-wc=22><strong>How do you stay up to date with fashion trends and how do you incorporate them into your wardrobe if you do?</strong></p><p id=ebOf-N-YoEqQ data-wc=78>I think as a creative person, it's impossible not to be in tune with the trends - it’s what we do. We have a radar and we absorb what's going on. I've been doing this for a long time now. so for me, &nbsp;travelling is super important, going to exhibitions, seeing people in the streets and seeing what's out there. I also trust myself, and what I feel like wearing when I have to design a new collection.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5fUw5mW7y data-wc=62>It's like, “What haven't I done yet?, what do I feel like wearing what is not in my wardrobe yet?" Of course I look at Instagram, but I try not to do that a lot because then we can end up doing the same kind of things. So it's more trusting my feelings about what I want to create and look for.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCVdkaMhrVWS data-wc=13><strong>Can you share some of your styling tips for mixing and matching pieces?</strong></p><p id=eCYFRhRmNo7h data-wc=25>I've been evolving a lot in the past few years. Before I used to mix and match everything and be super experimental no matter what.</p><p id=eRZ3k3UlCxoE data-wc=67>Now with age, I feel that one good thing is to have a statement piece, like for instance, sequin pants with the fringe at the bottom and then a cashmere sweater in a solid colour. Or a plain white shirt with a super colourful skirt. And the thing is, when I wear one of my own dresses, the styling is done. I only need to choose shoes.</p><p id=eetGqA5lp1rF data-wc=22>So I think it's quite easy for me, but I think you just need one statement piece, then wear it with basics.</p><p id=etZ-QgmcB1Re data-wc=10><strong>What's your strategy for creating memorable looks for evening parties?</strong></p><p id=eIXHIlQ-6PGT data-wc=30>For me, it's about the fun and the drama. I imagine myself having a blast in a dress that when you wear it, you become the best version of yourself.</p><p id=eICMqlI4VT8Z data-wc=38>This was what I hope my dresses do with people. They put you in a mood that allows you to have a lot of fun to be extroverted, to enjoy yourself and feel super comfortable in your skin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue8Kuo62topp8dnyWbGtqZ6Sdsm6ywKyfoqeeYravv8idnKtllJ6us8WMnJyloZFir6a%2BzZqpnadf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-fashion-insider-diary-celia-bernardo.html&text=The%20Fashion%20Insider%20Diary%3a%20Celia%20Bernardo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-fashion-insider-diary-celia-bernardo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-fashion-insider-diary-celia-bernardo.html&title=The%20Fashion%20Insider%20Diary%3a%20Celia%20Bernardo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-fashion-insider-diary-celia-bernardo.html&title=The%20Fashion%20Insider%20Diary%3a%20Celia%20Bernardo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-fashion-insider-diary-celia-bernardo.html&title=The%20Fashion%20Insider%20Diary%3a%20Celia%20Bernardo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-fashion-insider-diary-celia-bernardo.html&description=The%20Fashion%20Insider%20Diary%3a%20Celia%20Bernardo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-truth-behind-paris-jackson-s-relationship-with-her-mother.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth Behind Paris Jackson's Relationship With Her Mother">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-48-best-murder-mystery-movies-of-all-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 48 Best Murder Mystery Movies of All Time">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

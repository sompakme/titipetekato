So I read the script and I said, ‚ÄòYes, this person obviously knows Greeks.'‚Äù</p><p>The know-it-all Gus was famous for thinking that Windex would cure just about any ailment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually sick of Windex,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere must have been hundreds of bottles sent to me, and then there were all those people who asked me to autograph their Windex bottles.‚Äù</p><p>He also reprised the role for the short-lived 2003 CBS sitcom&nbsp;My Big Fat Greek Life.</p><p>On Wednesday, Vardalos paid tribute to the man who played her boisterous Greek father on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Twitter</a>, writing: ‚ÄúMichael Constantine, the dad to our cast-family, a gift to the written word, and always a friend.

Brooks, was ahead of its time, featuring an integrated cast that tackled serious contemporary issues during its five-season (1969-74) run.</p><p>Constantine also portrayed Big John, a pool-playing associate of Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason), in Robert Rossen‚Äôs atmospheric The Hustler (1961); was among those taking a whirlwind tour of Europe in If It‚Äôs Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium (1969); and played an intelligence officer from behind the Iron Curtain in Don‚Äôt Drink the Water (1969), a film version of Woody Allen‚Äôs Broadway hit.</p><p>On the stage, Constantine served as Paul Muni‚Äôs understudy in the original 1955-57 production of Inherit the Wind on Broadway and then appeared with Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft in The Miracle Worker, playing the head of the institute for the blind.</p><p>He was born&nbsp;Gus Efstration&nbsp;on May 22, 1927, the son of an iron worker. After Reading High School and a stint as the manager of the dairy department at his local grocery store, he didn‚Äôt really know what he wanted to do for a living. A chance encounter with a friend who had left for New York to become an actress convinced him to follow her lead.</p><p>Constantine eventually studied acting with Howard Da Silva (Broadway‚Äôs Oklahoma!) and spent nearly almost two years with the Inherit the Wind company. He then played a character based on attorney Clarence Darrow opposite Dean Stockwell, Roddy McDowall and Da Silva in Compulsion, a dramatization of the Leopold and Loeb murder trial.</p><p>In The Miracle Worker, he portrayed Anagnos, the man who put Annie Sullivan (Bancroft) with the Keller family.</p><p>Constantine made his big-screen debut alongside Mickey Rooney in the Death Row-set The Last Mile (1959), directed by Howard W. Koch. He soon proved adept at TV guest-starring roles in the 1960s, appearing on The Defenders, Naked City, Dr. Kildare, The Untouchables, The Twilight Zone,&nbsp;Perry Mason, Ironside and The Flying Nun.</p><p>Constantine had a regular role as one of the apartment-building residents, a photographer, on the 1966-67 NBC sitcom Hey, Landlord, created by <a href=#>Garry Marshall</a> and Jerry Belson, and he starred as a night court judge on the 1976-77 NBC comedy Sirota‚Äôs Court (that show also featured <a href=#>Fred Willard</a> and Ted Ross).</p><p>On NBC‚Äôs Remington Steele, Constantine showed up on a few episodes as eager businessman George Edward Mulch.</p><p>His film r√©sum√© also included Beau Geste (1966), Steve McQueen‚Äôs The Reivers (1969), The North Avenue Irregulars (1979), Prancer (1989), My Life (1993) and The Juror (1996).</p><p>Constantine was married and divorced twice.&nbsp;Survivors include his sisters, Patricia and Chris.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofK61wqGYnqRdmLyvv9Oapa2hnpp6pbHAnWSmsV2Xtqh5xZqrZp%2BimrKsedaem52hnpx6cn6SbmdqaGJqfXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-constantine-the-father-in-my-big-fat-greek-wedding-dies-at-94-the-hollywood-repo.html&text=Michael%20Constantine%2c%20the%20Father%20in%20My%20Big%20Fat%20Greek%20Wedding%2c%20Dies%20at%2094%20%20The%20Hollywood%20Repo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-constantine-the-father-in-my-big-fat-greek-wedding-dies-at-94-the-hollywood-repo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-constantine-the-father-in-my-big-fat-greek-wedding-dies-at-94-the-hollywood-repo.html&title=Michael%20Constantine%2c%20the%20Father%20in%20My%20Big%20Fat%20Greek%20Wedding%2c%20Dies%20at%2094%20%20The%20Hollywood%20Repo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-constantine-the-father-in-my-big-fat-greek-wedding-dies-at-94-the-hollywood-repo.html&title=Michael%20Constantine%2c%20the%20Father%20in%20My%20Big%20Fat%20Greek%20Wedding%2c%20Dies%20at%2094%20%20The%20Hollywood%20Repo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-constantine-the-father-in-my-big-fat-greek-wedding-dies-at-94-the-hollywood-repo.html&title=Michael%20Constantine%2c%20the%20Father%20in%20My%20Big%20Fat%20Greek%20Wedding%2c%20Dies%20at%2094%20%20The%20Hollywood%20Repo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-constantine-the-father-in-my-big-fat-greek-wedding-dies-at-94-the-hollywood-repo.html&description=Michael%20Constantine%2c%20the%20Father%20in%20My%20Big%20Fat%20Greek%20Wedding%2c%20Dies%20at%2094%20%20The%20Hollywood%20Repo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./movies-starring-diane-venora.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Movies starring Diane Venora">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./maude-apatow-ethnicity-nationality-race-family-body-measurements-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maude Apatow Ethnicity, Nationality, Race, Family, Body measurements, career">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

That makes the Christmas holidays the ideal opportunity to see what all the fuss is about. Rest assured, the fuss is warranted. Jesse Armstrong’s wildly entertaining dramedy about warring siblings and corporate greed with Shakespearean undertones and biting British humour is undoubtedly one of the best small-screen creations of the last decade. Its final episodes, which aired this spring, were some of the most widely discussed moments on TV this year. Sit back and enjoy the ride.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Succession is available to watch on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nowtv.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Now TV" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Now TV</a></p><span class="css-1cag8cc e16kmapv2">3</span><h2 class="css-h8eytx e16kmapv5">Beckham</h2><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Beckham documentary series - Official Trailer (Netflix)" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/beckham-documentary-series-trailer-6509c145a3c1f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Autumn 2023 was defined by what might accurately be described as Beckham fever. What happened to bring the football legend back to zeitgeist dominance was this four-part Netflix documentary. With unfettered access to David and his family, as well as copious amounts of archival footage, this caused a serious resurgence of nineties and noughties nostalgia as well as some much-deserved revisionism regarding the press treatment of Victoria.

The Bear is one of those rare television gems: a series that just gets better and better. The second season of this lauded show – about a struggling restaurant in Chicago, its tempestuous workers, and the tragic and complicated family behind it – arrived this year and was explosively good, cementing the series as one of the best things on TV right now. It shrewdly eschewed the established format of its first season (all fast-paced kitchen scenes and exquisitely scripted arguments) and opted to slow the pace, with standalone episodes focusing on individual characters and one corker of a Christmas flashback which deserves every award going.

After first debuting in November 2016, the final episodes of The Crown finally landed in December 2023. Netflix’s royal behemoth has done everything from courting national controversy to launching some fairly seismic careers (see <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/make-up-nails/a43465536/vanessa-kirby-beauty-bag-video/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanessa Kirby" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vanessa Kirby</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a42320531/emma-corrin-jack-oconnell-lady-chatterley-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emma Corrin" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emma Corrin</a>) and now its six-season, multi-decades-long arc has come to an end. The first slice of season six dropped in November, with a four-episode farewell to Princess Diana, embodied eerily faultlessly by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/a41887178/elizabeth-debicki-dior-bag-video/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth Debicki" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Elizabeth Debicki</a>. The Crown’s last collection of episodes focuses on a university-age Prince William and Kate Middleton, as well as the wedding of Charles and Camilla. Love it or hate it, this show has never not been peerlessly stylish and perfectly performed (who could forget Olivia Colman and Helena Bonham Carter's star turns, or Gillian Anderson's transformation into Margaret Thatcher?) Monarchy has never been so entertaining.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Crown is available to watch on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.netflix.com/gb/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Netflix class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Netflix</a></p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p>Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSyr8DEq6uaoZ6isq%2FAjqBra2tgbn5zf46bnKysXanDbr%2FHqK6sZWJlf3R7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-best-tv-shows-and-series-to-catch-up-on-from-2023.html&text=The%20best%20TV%20shows%20and%20series%20to%20catch%20up%20on%20from%202023&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-best-tv-shows-and-series-to-catch-up-on-from-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-tv-shows-and-series-to-catch-up-on-from-2023.html&title=The%20best%20TV%20shows%20and%20series%20to%20catch%20up%20on%20from%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-best-tv-shows-and-series-to-catch-up-on-from-2023.html&title=The%20best%20TV%20shows%20and%20series%20to%20catch%20up%20on%20from%202023" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-tv-shows-and-series-to-catch-up-on-from-2023.html&title=The%20best%20TV%20shows%20and%20series%20to%20catch%20up%20on%20from%202023" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-tv-shows-and-series-to-catch-up-on-from-2023.html&description=The%20best%20TV%20shows%20and%20series%20to%20catch%20up%20on%20from%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./villagers-left-stunned-after-watching-goat-walk-on-hind-legs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Villagers left stunned after watching goat walk on hind legs">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tamara-johnson-george-net-worth-in-2024-how-rich-is-she-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tamara Johnson-George Net Worth in 2024 How Rich is She Now?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

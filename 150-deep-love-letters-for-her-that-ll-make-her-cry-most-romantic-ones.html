You have such a profound influence on my life that I cannot erase the memories of you even if I live for a million years.</li><li>I am so glad to have met you in this life because you gave me a reason to always live with you until the end.

Here is a list of some cute and romantic love messages for her to make her day.</p><ul><li>Life has been challenging for us, things changed, and everything went down the drain. I am grateful that you stayed with me, and I assure you that I will give you a better life than what we had.</li><li>My heart aches when you are not with me. It makes me realise how dull my world would be if you were not in it. I love you.</li><li>I want to be with you now, tomorrow, and every other day after. You show me love in different shades. You are meant to be with me because I cannot imagine how my life would be with someone else.</li><li>I was matching a star to every reason I fell in love with you and was shocked when I noticed it was past midnight, yet I was not done counting.</li><li>I am sure that you understand the level of respect I have for you by now. It is not because you did anything special to earn it but because of how much I value you.</li><li>I was wrong to take our moments, memories and dreams for granted. I hope it is not too late to make it up to you. I love you, princess.</li><li>Seeing you daily is a blessing because my heart bubbles with excitement when anything reminds me of you.</li><li>I hope your day is full of green lights and the fastest lines through all queues for you to get back into my arms soon. I love you.</li><li>I miss you, my dear angel, the treasure of my heart, the one I wish to spend the rest of my life with. Holding you is the best feeling ever!</li><li>I enjoy how you look at me, smile at me and kiss me. Attraction brought us together, but now it is love that will keep us together.</li><li>I thank God because I spend every day in bliss, and I handle the day's tasks with happiness because I have you. I thank him for bringing you into my life.</li><li>I have fallen in love with you and decided to be with you. The circumstances in which we met do not matter to me. It is all about you because you are my one and only.</li><li>When I say I adore you, I do not mean that I adore you more than you adore me. I love every pain and happiness I have and will encounter.</li><li>I do not want to be a player anymore because what we have is beautiful. If I offend you in any way, please take me as I am because I am willing to change for you.</li><li>I hope we will not forget each other's names when we grow old. May short memory never be part of our old age struggles, babe.</li><li>I am glad that our love does not fade even when we sometimes take out our bad moods on each other. I love you.</li><li>My pen is my brush, and my diary is my canvas. I will paint our happy and sad moments for our grandchildren to see when we are gone.</li><li>I love your honesty, your passion, your resilience, your courage, your partnership, and your smile. You are a dream come true.</li><li>No matter what has happened. No matter what you’ve done. No matter what you will do. I will always love you.</li><li>If you ask me to make a last wish, it would be to go on like this, holding your hands in mine till my last breath.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b909dab62eeec28e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ugandan woman’s story goes viral after her husband steals her money and uses it to marry her best friend</span></p></a><h3>Love messages to make her cry</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d9b767e62c5f0366.jpg><p class=align-left>Are you looking for a love message to make her cry? A nicely crafted love message will let her know you are thinking about them. If you have wondered how to touch her heart with love words, use the letters below.</p><ul><li>I had a strange dream tonight. You challenged me to win your heart. Can I try? Will you let us see where this gets us?</li><li>I am writing to you, hoping to show you a glimpse of my mind and the worth I have placed on you. You are everything I ever dreamed of and the only one who dared to love me, despite my shortcomings.</li><li>Let us not hate each other but let love and time heal all wounds. I am confident that you are my soulmate and that our relationship will overcome this dark phase. I still cherish you.</li><li>Because of you, my life has become magical and worth living. As candlelight lights up a dark room, so do you light up my world.</li><li>I cannot wait to see the treasure I have been waiting for. I pray for the day I will finally kiss you. There is a permanent place for you in my heart.</li><li>Thank you for loving me. I may not say it out loud, and I may not have the guts to write it on paper, yet here I am sending you this text just to let you know.</li><li>The happiness you have given me is so special. My whole day is filled with thoughts of you. Getting to know you is the best thing that has ever happened to me.</li><li>From now till my last breath, I will always hold you in high esteem because you deserve endless affection. You are a great woman among millions of women. I value you!</li><li>I am truly blessed to have you as a part of my life, and I cannot wait for the day I marry you. When I say 'I care for you'. I mean every word.</li><li>I do not know why I adore you when I do not know you that well. I believe I met you somewhere, maybe in my past life, and it is crazy that I do not even care that I do not know you that well.</li><li>Before I met you, the world had given me many reasons to hate. Now, I cannot keep hating the world because it has granted me such a sweet and beautiful person with a kind heart.</li><li>Before I started writing this letter, I thought it would be easy to pen down how much I love you, but I do not know how to convey everything I feel on this piece of paper.</li><li>Looking back to the beginning, loving you is one thing I have done right all my life. No matter what happens, my adoration for you is constant. Thank you for being the brightest star in my life. I love you forever.</li><li>A day that is void of your voice means an incomplete one. With your voice comes soul-melting laughter, which I need to have a great and happy day. I hope mine makes you feel the same way.</li><li>I would have hugged you a little tighter, kissed you a little longer, and told you how much you mean to me if I knew I would miss you this much.</li><li>With you, everything I need in a woman is complete because you are so sweet and wonderful. I am happy today because you showed me the best of everything. I will forever treasure you, and I love you so much.</li><li>I smile while staring at the shooting stars because I know that you also remember me when you see them despite the distance.</li><li>Remember our first kiss? I waited for the perfect moment to steal it from you because I was scared you would pull back. Little did I know that my girl was all in.</li><li>I am uncertain about what the future holds for us, whether our dreams will come to pass or how far our love will go, but I know that I love you.</li><li>You are my star on cloudy nights, my sunshine on a stormy day, and my beautiful flower in dull moments. Sweet dreams, my love.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9eecd9301260264d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"If I pay today, who will pay tomorrow?"

She will appreciate the love and emotion in your words.</p><ul><li>When we are together, seconds quickly turn into minutes and minutes to hours. From hours into a day, then to weeks, all in close succession. You make time fly when you are around. I want you to know what a wonder you have been to my world, but you know that words are not my strong suit. You have been the best for me in all times and all things. You are like an angel who has been more than a friend to me.</li><li>You are my dream come true. You are the reason why a smile never leaves my cheeks, my pearl of passion. I just want you to know that I cherish you! I want the best for you because you love me. I am so glad to have you as my sweetheart. Every day and night, your love is always in my heart.</li><li>You are the most beautiful person in the world. I am thrilled to be around you. There's nobody like you in this entire universe. You are the only person with whom I would rather share my time. You are the reason why I wake up every day. You are the light that guides me through the darkness.</li><li>What is love without you, my baby? I want to carry you like a baby and pamper you till we sink deep into the ocean of love. Call me daddy, sponsor, sugar-boy, or anything you want because I am here to beautify your world with your favourite colours.</li><li>Sometimes I get caught up with life's issues, and I start to worry. I get down and alone in thoughts, I feel like a lost child without a home, but the kind of affection you give me keeps me hanging on. All I will ever need is you. Thank you for always being there for me.</li><li>Seeing you smile is enough food for my tummy. It is beautiful to be with you on a happy or sad day. Your name is carved on my heart, and every time I am alone, you are everything I think about. I cherish you beyond your imagination.</li><li>Thinking about you brings me inexplicable joy. Regardless of how bad my day has been, I know I can always count on you to make me feel better. Sweetheart, your love is deeper than the deepest ocean, more extensive than the skies and brighter than the brightest star that shines all night.</li><li>Seeing you smile means a great deal to me. I would never want to see you sad. I would do anything humanly possible to keep your face gleaming with smiles and laughter because your affection is everything to me. It is even more than I bargained for, and I am glad I got you.</li><li>You know you are my angel and my heartbeat. You make up for everything life deprives me because you are a priceless treasure. I loved you from the start, and your smile gives me confidence. I am forever yours, my darling.</li><li>I have got enough reason to breathe every day with you in my life. You are the best, and nobody comes close. I cannot afford to spend the rest of my life without you. Thank you for making every moment with you golden. Kisses.</li><li>I wish I could open my heart for you to see. I swear you will never find any trace of a black spot in it. I am yours now and till the end of time. When I was weak, you were my strength, and I will be forever grateful for that.</li><li>Sweetheart, for me, your love goes further than the sky above us. It is deeper than the deepest part of the ocean. It is brighter than the brightest stars at night. And my loving wife, just so you know, whenever I think of you, your image raises my soul.</li><li>I will cherish you till the end of time because you have been the reason for my constant strive to reach great heights. On a platter of gold and diamonds, your love brought me happiness and peace of mind.</li><li>You are my dream come true, the love of my life. I wish you happiness and fulfilment because your presence in my life means so much. Now I am so calm, not worrying anymore because you are by my side.</li><li>You are my best friend and lover, and I would never trade you for anything in the world. If I were asked to choose between having you or anyone else in my life, I would pick you every single time. You are the most crucial thing in my life, and I wouldn't change a thing about you. No matter where we end up together, I will always have you in my heart.</li><li>As your angelic name implies, you must be straight out of heaven and the most valued woman in my world. For that reason, I pat myself on the back whenever possible for choosing you to be my girl.</li><li>Our love is extraordinary, and there is none other like it. I feel as if I have won the lottery with you. You are a person who is so unique and magical. You make my life and my world a thousand times better just by being there.</li><li>Thanks to the stars above, we came together. At first, it was just a liking, but soon, it turned into deep love. I will not lie; I felt something in my heart when I first saw you. That something was certain that the feeling I got was true. And now I know I have been waiting all my life for that moment when I fell in love with you.</li><li>I cannot thank you enough for being the shooting star that made my dream come true. I cannot appreciate you enough for being the light I walk with through life's darkest path and for being my courage in all the battles life challenges me with every day. I cherish you, my baby.</li><li>There is nothing in this world I could compare your tender hands to. And your eyes, I could just drown in them every time I look at you. They are the mirror of our love. It seems my body is filling with you more and more each day and night.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4c742619b0397571.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"I trusted him": Man uses wife's money to marry her best friend, dumps her with 3 kids, painful video surfaces</span></p></a><h2>What is the best love letter ever written?</h2><p class=align-left>Some of the most <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">famed romantic letters</a>were from French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte to his wife Joséphine, novelist Ernest Hemingway to actress Marlene Dietrich and Georgia O'Keeffe to photographer Alfred Stieglitz.</p><h2>How can I impress a girl by letter?</h2><p class=align-left>There are several <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tips to use</a> when writing her a love letter.

"I think it's so important for her to have a good sense of where she comes from in order for her to get to know herself. "While Kate says that she is keen to remind Mathilda about her dad, however, the siblings' own father recently said how much he feels <a class=hm-link href=#>his granddaughter herself keeps Heath's spirit alive</a>.<strong>"She's got his energy," </strong>Kim Ledger told Australian news channel, Channel 10.

"Every time I really miss him and wonder where he's gone, I just look at her," she told Vogue in 2013.In another recent interview, Kate recalled how enthusiastic her brother was about lending fellow actors a helping hand. "Heath loved to help others," she told Confidential. "He did everything he could to support his Australian mates in their careers and would offer his house, car or anything to help them.""We used to laugh at the number of random people at any one time living in his LA home," she added.

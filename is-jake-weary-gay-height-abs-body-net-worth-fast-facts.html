There is no further information regarding his other body measurements, such as his biceps and chest size. He is currently active on all social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram where he has up to 15,000 followers.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Quick Facts About&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Jake Weary</span></strong></h2><table width=289><table class="table table-responsive"><tbody><tr><td><strong><span>Full Name:</span></strong></td><td><span>Jacob “Jake” weary</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>Date of Birth:</span></strong></td><td><span>February 14, 1990</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>Horoscope:</span></strong></td><td><span>Aquarius</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>Place of birth:</span></strong></td><td><span>Trenton, New Jersey, USA.</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>Father’s name:</span></strong></td><td><span>Allen Cudney “AC” Weary</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>Mother’s name:</span></strong></td><td><span>Kim Zimmer</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>Brothers and sisters:</span></strong></td><td><span>2 (Rachel and Max Weary)</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>The size:</span></strong></td><td><span>1.7 m (5 ft 7 in)</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>Weight:</span></strong></td><td><span>65kg</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>Occupation:</span></strong></td><td><span>Actor, Music Composer</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>Net value:</span></strong></td><td><span>$1.6 million</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>Sexual orientation:</span></strong></td><td><span>Straight</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong><span>Nationality:</span></strong></td><td><span>American</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3>Advertisement <a class=close-stky-ads onclick='if(!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers)return!1;document.getElementById("bl_banner").style.display="none"' data-cf-modified-9236d43c2168364494cafef2- href=#></a><p>Copyright © 2024.

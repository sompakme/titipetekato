And when one’s ego is endangered, one will almost always strike out.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span><span>In a similar vein, you could wonder what the precept “when given the option between being correct</span></span> <span><span>and being nice, choose kindness” really means.</span></span></h3><p>When given the option between doing what is right and doing what is nice, choose kindness. It suggests to me that you should be courteous rather than harshly correcting someone’s behaviour. For example, I may be accurate, but I do not make a big deal about it since I am aware that someone else may not have been correct as well as I am.</p><p></p><h3>Furthermore, which is more important: doing what is right or being compassionate?</h3><p>In this case, the remark from Scott Fitzgerald comes into play: “Being nice and listening to others are frequently more essential than continually attempting to be right and prove others wrong.”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3><span><span>Second, when faced with the decision between being correct and being nice, choose kindness as an</span></span> <span><span>example instead.</span></span></h3><p>“When given the option between being correct and being nice, CHOOSE KIND.” This is the principle to live by. This principle requires that you be considerate of others. Consider the following scenario: you do well on a test. You can see your pal over there, and he didn’t do that well, too.</p><p></p><h3>When do you take the opportunity to be correct or to be kind?</h3><p>“If you have a choice between doing what is right and doing what is nice, choose kindness” (Dr. Wayne W. Dyer) It happens every now and then that you come across a book that sticks out, that makes you feel better, or that causes you to think more deeply.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>There were 30 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3><span><span>In what way does the September precept, “When given the option between doing what is right and</span></span> <span><span>doing what is kind, choose kindness,” apply?</span></span></h3><p>The terms in this collection (16) The precept for September is When presented with the option of being correct or being nice, choose kindness. This phrase reminds me that you don’t always have to be correct in your decisions in life. All that is required is that you be nice and courteous to yourself and to others.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Who stated that it is preferable to be nice than to be correct in every situation?</h3><p>Anne Lamott said the following: “It is preferable to be nice than to be correct.”</p><p></p><h3>What does Auggie use to compare his eating habits to?</h3><p>August despises the way he eats because of the way he seems to be eating when he does. When he was younger, he was born with a cleft palate, which was repaired by surgery, but he still has a hole in his mouth.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the definition of Choose kind?</h3><p>The Choose Kind Movement, which was inspired by R.J. Palacio’s narrative WONDER, seeks to disseminate the idea of good social change by encouraging individuals to engage in acts of kindness on a daily basis. Student participation in the Challenge will encourage them to consistently offer compassion, acceptance, and respect to their classmates.</p><p></p><h3>What are the benefits of being kind?</h3><p>It is crucial to be nice because it helps you feel better about your own abilities. When you do things for other people, whether it’s helping them with math or schoolwork or anything else, it simply makes you feel good about yourself because you know you’ve helped someone. Just like respect, kindness is a two-way street that requires both giving and receiving. If you want to be respected, you must first demonstrate respect to others.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What type of wonderment does Auggie have?</h3><p>Auggie Pullman, the primary character of Wonder, is a little boy named August. The combination of Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia caused his facial abnormality at birth, which prohibited him from attending a traditional school until the fifth grade, when he was accepted into Beecher Preparatory School.</p><p></p><h3>What exactly is a precept in the book, I’m curious?</h3><p>A monthly precept is presented by Auggie’s instructor Mr. Browne, who defines it as “something that helps guide us when making judgments about truly important things” in the book Wonder. Choose one of the tenets listed below and write an essay explaining what it means to you personally.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What does it imply when your acts become your monuments?</h3><p>“Your Deeds are your Monuments,” according to me, indicates that what you do will be what you are remembered for. Instead of leaving a statue, you should leave a deed. Doing a good act creates a lasting impression on someone, and every time you do one, you leave your stamp on the world.</p><p></p><h3>When you are given the option of being right or being wrong, what do you choose?</h3><p>“When given the option between doing what is right and doing what is nice, choose kindness.” “Dr. Wayne W. Dyer” is a pseudonym for Wayne W. Dyer.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What are some inspirational compassion quotes?</h3><p>Kindness Inspirational Sayings Confidence is built via kindness in speech. When we consider with kindness, we achieve profundity. Love is created through acts of kindness. No act of compassion, no matter how little, is ever thrown away. Aesop. Matter of Inspiring Consideration A little amount of time was wasted. You can never perform a good deed too soon because you never know when it may be too late to help someone. You’ll Never Know Until It’s Too Late.</p><p></p><h3>What was the title of Wayne Dyer’s most recent book?</h3><p>While giving his last Melbourne lecture, Wayne W. Dyer discussed his latest book, Memories of Heaven (http://bit.ly/1VXQ9GY), which was released only a few days before his death.</p><p></p><h3>What is the significance of being correct?</h3><p>Right equates to safety. Being correct implies surviving on a physical and social level. It also implies surviving on an emotional level. It is intertwined with the most crucial emotional need of all: one’s own self-esteem. If we’re correct, we’ll be pleased with our accomplishments.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the significance of being correct?</h3><p>Being correct is really crucial when it comes to human conduct. Actions have repercussions, and doing something wrong will almost always result in injury to oneself or others. Actions have repercussions, and doing something wrong will almost always result in injury to oneself or others. As a result, it is quite important to constantly behave in the proper manner.</p><p></p><h3>What is the significance of being on time?</h3><p>If being on time is vital to you, you may earn respect by being a person who is always on time, no matter what. Being on time can assist you to reduce your stress levels (after all, few things are as stressful as always running late). Being on schedule can help you build better relationships with your coworkers since no one enjoys being kept waiting.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6wn5qsXZm8pr%2BMrZ%2BeZaGqvLWxjLCfnqZdnLa3sc1mq6GdXZi1sLXCnmSbnaSssqa6jJucoqaXYr%2Bqs8etZKiqXZeyqrrGZqKippRisKm7zqycZqOZo7FvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-the-quote-when-given-the-choice-between-being-right-or-being-kind-choose-kind.html&text=What%20does%20the%20quote%20when%20given%20the%20choice%20between%20being%20right%20or%20being%20kind%20choose%20kind%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-the-quote-when-given-the-choice-between-being-right-or-being-kind-choose-kind.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-the-quote-when-given-the-choice-between-being-right-or-being-kind-choose-kind.html&title=What%20does%20the%20quote%20when%20given%20the%20choice%20between%20being%20right%20or%20being%20kind%20choose%20kind%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-does-the-quote-when-given-the-choice-between-being-right-or-being-kind-choose-kind.html&title=What%20does%20the%20quote%20when%20given%20the%20choice%20between%20being%20right%20or%20being%20kind%20choose%20kind%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-the-quote-when-given-the-choice-between-being-right-or-being-kind-choose-kind.html&title=What%20does%20the%20quote%20when%20given%20the%20choice%20between%20being%20right%20or%20being%20kind%20choose%20kind%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-the-quote-when-given-the-choice-between-being-right-or-being-kind-choose-kind.html&description=What%20does%20the%20quote%20when%20given%20the%20choice%20between%20being%20right%20or%20being%20kind%20choose%20kind%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-short-for-a-man.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is short for a man?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./smino-drops-sultry-new-single-matinee.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Smino Drops Sultry New Single &amp;quot;Matinee&amp;quot;">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

Wow, wagered it all!" as Jill clutched her chest and revealed she bet her entire $16,200 giving her $32,400.</p><p>"Took a big chance and it paid off!" he added.</p><h2><strong>'WTF WAS WITH THAT WAGER?'</strong></h2><p>Jill secured a spot in the finals at the end of the week, but fans were less than secure on Jill's gigantic bet since she had such a wide lead and contestants don't keep their earnings in the tournament.</p><p>One fan wrote on <a href=#>Reddit</a>: "[What the f**k] was up with that wagering? Had Final Jeopardy! been a Triple-Stumper, Jill would've pulled a real-life <a href=#>Cliff Clavin</a>," referencing Cheers.</p><p>"Since this is a tournament, winners don't get to keep their winnings. No upside for going all-in."</p><p>Another was bothered by Ken's remark and wrote: "Was Ken being cute telling Gabriel the correct response was 'actually Victoria I?'</p><p>"Surely he knows monarchs aren't designated with an ordinal number until they share the name with a descendant."</p><p>Others went wild over Jill's all-or-nothing move, as a third wrote: "She bet everything, holy s**t!"</p><p>"Congratulations, Jill! I can't believe she bet everything in final," wrote a fourth.</p><p>Another contestant from later this week wrote: “Can't wait to see how y'all experience this. We were screaming in the green room.”</p><p>One sign Jill was going to do well was that her original game was in January 2021- and she faced 7-time champion Brian Chang and eventual 6-time champion Zach Newkirk, who won the match.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/season-40-odd-side-comment-844292812.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/season-40-odd-side-comment-844292813.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/reveals-full-look-new-seasons-842944270-4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Screen-Shot-2023-09-11-at-6.10.25-PM.png><h2><strong>TAKING SECOND CHANCES</strong></h2><p>Ken walked out to a huge round of applause to clue fans in on how the new season will work.</p><p>Ken did not mention the Hollywood strikes or his decision to continue hosting through them in his intro.</p><p>He kicked off: “Welcome back to Season 40 of Jeopardy!. We’ll be kicking off this season with a <a href=#>Second Chance competition.</a></p><p>“Over the next three weeks, we’ll be inviting back 27 contestants who probably never thought they’d be back here on the <a href=#>Alex Trebek</a> stage.”</p><p>The contestants lost their initial games in 2020 and 2021; Ken continued: “Their first games may not have ended in victory, but their strong play showed us that they are indeed worthy of a second chance.</p><p>"The champion there will advance to a <a href=#>Champions Wild Card</a> tournament later this fall.”</p><p>The winner of that subsequent eight-week tournament will punch their ticket to the next Tournament of Champions.</p><h2><strong>THIS IS SEASON 40</strong></h2><p>Jeopardy!'s&nbsp;monumental&nbsp;<a href=#>Season 40</a>&nbsp;will run until July 26, 2024.</p><p>Because of the ongoing WGA and SAG strikes with actors and writers unable to settle fair pay negotiations, co-host <a href=#>Mayim is officially off the board.</a></p><p>It was announced on Monday that she is going to remain uninvolved until the strikes end and only Ken will host.</p><p>She bowed out in solidarity with the strikers, a big shakeup since she and Ken were tapped to split hosting after&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex</a>'s&nbsp;death in 2020.</p><p>A source earlier told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Messenger</a>&nbsp;that Mayim will likely&nbsp;<a href=#>not be back until the new year</a>, if not longer.</p><p>“She wasn’t fired," the insider shared.</p><p>"She’s choosing to stand with her union, and because of that, she was told it is unlikely she will return for the rest of the year, even if the strike is resolved before then.”</p><p>Mayim is a member of the&nbsp;striking&nbsp;actors’ union, SAG-AFTRA.</p><p>If the strikes don't end by 2024 - and since episodes tape two months in advance - Mayim will not return until at least the new year if not next season (or next fall).</p><p>Ken being the only host isn't the only huge change this season.</p><p>Aside from not having new contestants and no Mayim, the other major change is the clues.</p><p>The <a href=#>game show</a> is re-using questions from past seasons while without its writers, but most of the questions did not appear to have previously aired.</p><p>One fan remarked: "I haven't found any repeats. Some of the questions have been asked in the past in differently phrased ways, but that is like 50 questions per game under normal circumstances."</p><p>That being said, according to the <a href=# aria-label="J! Archive (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">J! Archive</a>, Final Jeopardy was nearly identical to one that was presented during a tournament in 2006.</p><p>And as Ken mentioned, the&nbsp;<a href=#>new season</a>&nbsp;will also use past contestants.</p><p>The Second Chance Tournament will run for three weeks followed by a brand new tournament, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Champions Wild Card</a>, which will pit the winners from that series against brief Season 37 and 38 champions.</p><p>The tournaments will take fans into December, but given the strikes, what will air after that is unannounced.</p><p>Showrunner&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Davies</a>&nbsp;explained on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Inside Jeopardy!” podcast</a>&nbsp;that it “wouldn’t be fair to have new contestants making their first appearance” on the show with material that isn’t original or that was written pre-strike.</p><p>"The material that we’re gonna be using is a combination of material that our WGA writers wrote before the strike, which is still in the database and material that is being redeployed from multiple, multiple seasons of the show.”</p><p>In addition, a 2023 Tournament of Champions is happening, but not until the strikes are over.</p><p>Several Season 39 champs, including&nbsp;<a href=#>Ray LaLonde, Cris, Hannah Wilson, and Ben Chan</a>, said they would not participate in the TOC until the strikes are concluded.</p><p>Fans are hoping the strikes are resolved soon so they can enjoy the new TOC and hallmark 40th season, which was meant to be a buzzworthy moment for the beloved show.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ken has&nbsp;<a href=#>faced backlash from some fans and former players</a>&nbsp;for his decision to cross the picket line.</p><p>Ken has kept relatively quiet on the subject besides&nbsp;<a href=#>resharing a statement from the show’s executive producer</a>&nbsp;referencing how the late Alex continued hosting during the 2007 to 2008 writers’ strike.</p><p>Davies also&nbsp;announced a&nbsp;<a href=#>bump in consolation prizes</a>&nbsp;for the upcoming season (when regular episodes resume) and said that he admires and misses the show’s beloved writers.</p><p>The news caused a scathing response from&nbsp;<a href=#>Masters winner&nbsp;James Holzhauer</a>, who took&nbsp;to the platform&nbsp;<a href=#>X</a>,&nbsp;formerly known as Twitter, to&nbsp;<a href=#>call out the show</a>.</p><p>“If you don’t have time to listen, here’s the executive summary of today’s announcement,” James, 39,&nbsp;wrote, sharing a link to the podcast episode.</p><p>“1:00-2:00: Jeopardy’s writers are invaluable and we couldn’t produce the show without them,” he continued.</p><p>“2:00-15:00: Here is how we will produce the upcoming season without them.”</p><p>Mayim&nbsp;is also being replaced by&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;which airs on ABC for the entire next season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US

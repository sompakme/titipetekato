Scorsese has since taken a break from her acting career, but on the eve of every Christmas season, the memory of her is rekindled thanks to television stations which continue to air the film as part of their holiday broadcast.&nbsp;Nicolette Scorsese spent some time in Hollywood after the film’s release, but sadly wouldn’t last long like co-stars Juliette Lewis, Johnny Galecki and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, all of whom became household names in the film industry.&nbsp;Looking back, we take a look at the life and career of Nicolette Scorsese.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Nicolette Scorsese Organic</span></strong></h2><p><span>Nicolette Scorsese was born on January 6, 1954, in the United States.&nbsp;Boasting a tall and slender figure, Scorsese sought to become a model from an early age.&nbsp;She found mild success as a model representing certain brands in advertisements.</span></p><p><span>Fast forward to the 1980s, she started acting.&nbsp;She started out on the small screen and made her debut in a 1985 episode of the action television show,&nbsp;</span><span>The A-Team</span><span>.&nbsp;She then appeared in a 1987 episode of&nbsp;</span><span>Charles in Charge</span><span>&nbsp;before making her film debut in 1988’s&nbsp;</span><span>Perfect Victims</span><span>&nbsp;where she played the role of Melissa Cody.</span></p><p>Nicolette Scorsese’s next role was as Mary in National Lampoon’s&nbsp;<span>Christmas Vacation</span><span>&nbsp;(1989).&nbsp;The film which featured already established acts like Chevy Chase was what became his most well-known role.&nbsp;The film was a commercial success, grossing over $70 million on a $25 million budget.</span></p><p><span>Nicolette Scorsese became more visible in the 90s with roles in films like&nbsp;</span><span>Aspen Extreme</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>Helena of Boxing</span><span>, as well as shorts,&nbsp;</span><span>The Waiter</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Lone Greasers</span><span>.&nbsp;However, none of his roles have garnered as much attention as&nbsp;</span><span>Christmas Vacation</span><span>.&nbsp;On the small screen, she had&nbsp;</span><span>LA Law, Rebel Highway, Girls in Prison, ER</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>NYPD</span><span>&nbsp;Blue parts where she played two different roles in two episodes.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is she related to Martin Scorsese?</span></strong></h2><p><span>The name Scorsese is quite rare in Hollywood, so when Nicolette Scorsese appeared on the scenes, it was only fitting that people wondered if she was related to ace filmmaker Martin Scorsese.&nbsp;Well, Nicolette comes from another Scorsese family because she doesn’t have a family relationship with Martin.</span></p><p><span>Apart from a sibling relationship, many have wondered if Nicolette may have married the filmmaker famous for his many marriages in the past.&nbsp;However, of the five women Martin walked down the aisle with, none was Nicolette.&nbsp;On the other hand, Nicolette was never married either (at least when she became popular).</span></p><p>Martin and Nicolette’s only relationship has been a professional one, as the duo had the chance to work together on one of Martin’s works.</p><h2><strong><span>Where is she now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Without notice, Nicolette Scorsese quietly disappeared from the entertainment space.&nbsp;Maybe she was tired of the typical “hot girl” roles she kept getting.&nbsp;Scorsese was last seen in a 2000 episode of&nbsp;</span><span>NYPD Blue</span><span>.&nbsp;At the time, the actress was in her forties.&nbsp;Although she didn’t give a reason for her rather early retirement, the actress most likely got involved in some other non-Hollywood endeavor.&nbsp;His earnings from a fairly successful 15-year career would certainly not have been enough to last his entire life.</span></p><p><span>The former actress lives her life quietly away from the glitz and glamor that comes with the entertainment industry.&nbsp;It is not known if she is married or not.&nbsp;However, during her heyday, she reportedly dated two men.</span></p><p><span>Among those men was actor and director SeanPenn – who has a history of dating actresses, model musician Antonio Sabato Jr., Jellybean Benitez, and The Cult band member Billy Duffy who was rumored to be with she would come out in the late 90s. Rumor has it that Nicolette Scorsese had a child, a daughter named Shiloh with Billy Duffy.</span></p><p>Nicolette Scorsese may not have achieved stardom, but she did well to leave an indelible mark on Hollywood, all thanks to her role as Mary in&nbsp;<span>A Christmas Vacation</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGimmZi8rbHTrZxmq5Okv7Sx0p5km6GfYra0edKhnGaqlaGutbHDZquoZZ2Wv7W1zWaqnKeiqLK0sYywn56qlWK2tHnSoZxmpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnicolette-scorsese-bio-is-she-related-to-martin-scorsese-where-is-she-now.html&text=Nicolette%20Scorsese%20%20Bio%2c%20Is%20She%20Related%20To%20Martin%20Scorsese%2c%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnicolette-scorsese-bio-is-she-related-to-martin-scorsese-where-is-she-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnicolette-scorsese-bio-is-she-related-to-martin-scorsese-where-is-she-now.html&title=Nicolette%20Scorsese%20%20Bio%2c%20Is%20She%20Related%20To%20Martin%20Scorsese%2c%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnicolette-scorsese-bio-is-she-related-to-martin-scorsese-where-is-she-now.html&title=Nicolette%20Scorsese%20%20Bio%2c%20Is%20She%20Related%20To%20Martin%20Scorsese%2c%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnicolette-scorsese-bio-is-she-related-to-martin-scorsese-where-is-she-now.html&title=Nicolette%20Scorsese%20%20Bio%2c%20Is%20She%20Related%20To%20Martin%20Scorsese%2c%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnicolette-scorsese-bio-is-she-related-to-martin-scorsese-where-is-she-now.html&description=Nicolette%20Scorsese%20%20Bio%2c%20Is%20She%20Related%20To%20Martin%20Scorsese%2c%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ric-ocasek-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ric Ocasek Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./new-predator-movie-badlands-in-the-works-with-dan-trachtenberg.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New 'Predator' Movie Badlands in the Works with Dan Trachtenberg">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
